\begin{frame}{General Approach}

The general approach is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize to maximize L/D at a fixed angle of attack.
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item Predetermine the total wing area based on wind tunnel model.
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item Base the gap and stagger off the computed chord lengths.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent Some assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All the wings have the same planform.
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item Decalage angle is constant ($0^\circ$).
\end{itemize}
