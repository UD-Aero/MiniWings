\begin{frame}{Analysis Approach}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use AVL to determine lift and lift induced drag ($C_{D_i}$)
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item Use FRICTION (VT) Fortran code to calculate skin friction and pressure drag.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent Limitations of analysis include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Not capturing viscous interactions.
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item FRICTION code is limited to 1$^{st}$ approximation. Essentially determined for a single wing and then multiplied by the number of wings.
\end{itemize}
